# Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset

## Overview

The **Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset** comprises 374 entries detailing sleep and lifestyle factors of individuals. It includes demographic information, sleep metrics, physical activity levels, stress levels, and health indicators such as BMI, blood pressure, heart rate, daily steps, and the presence or absence of sleep disorders (e.g., Insomnia, Sleep Apnea). This dataset is designed to facilitate exploration of the relationships between lifestyle factors and sleep health, as well as to identify patterns associated with sleep disorders.

## Dataset Structure

| Quality of Sleep            | Subjective rating of sleep quality on a scale from 1 to 10.                     |
| Physical Activity Level     | Number of minutes the individual engages in physical activity daily.            |
| Stress Level                | Subjective rating of stress level on a scale from 1 to 10.                      |
| BMI Category                | BMI category of the individual (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).  |
| Blood Pressure              | Blood pressure measurement, indicated as systolic over diastolic (e.g., 120/80).|
| Heart Rate                  | Resting heart rate of the individual in beats per minute (bpm).                 |
| Daily Steps                 | Number of steps the individual takes per day.                                   |
| Sleep Disorder              | Presence or absence of a sleep disorder (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea, or NaN for missing). |

### Details about Sleep Disorder Categories
- **None**: The individual does not exhibit any specific sleep disorder.
- **Insomnia**: The individual experiences difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, leading to inadequate or poor-quality sleep.
- **Sleep Apnea**: The individual suffers from pauses in breathing during sleep, resulting in disrupted sleep patterns and potential health risks.

## Data Types

- **Numerical**:
  - Age (int64)
  - Sleep Duration (float64)
  - Quality of Sleep (int64)
  - Physical Activity Level (int64)
  - Stress Level (int64)
  - Heart Rate (int64)
  - Daily Steps (int64)
- **Categorical**:
  - Gender (object/string)
  - Occupation (object/string)
  - BMI Category (object/string)
  - Sleep Disorder (object/string, with NaN for missing values)
- **String**:
  - Blood Pressure (object/string, format: "systolic/diastolic")

## Missing Values

- The **Sleep Disorder** column contains 219 missing values (NaN), indicating that no sleep disorder information was recorded for those individuals. This could imply either unreported data or the absence of a diagnosed disorder, depending on the context of use.

## Usage

This dataset is suitable for a variety of analytical and research purposes, including:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Investigate relationships between lifestyle factors (e.g., physical activity, stress) and sleep quality or disorders.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Identify correlations or trends among variables such as age, occupation, and sleep metrics.
- **Machine Learning**: Develop predictive models to classify sleep disorders or predict sleep duration/quality based on health and lifestyle indicators.
- **Data Visualization**: Create visual representations to communicate findings effectively.

## Notes

- **Blood Pressure**: Stored as a string in the format "systolic/diastolic" (e.g., "120/80"). For numerical analysis, it may need to be split into separate systolic and diastolic columns.
- **Duplicates**: The dataset contains 242 duplicate rows. Users should check for and handle duplicates based on their analysis requirements.
- **Subjective Data**: Columns like Quality of Sleep and Stress Level are based on self-reported ratings, which may vary in accuracy or consistency.
- **File Format**: The dataset is provided in CSV format (`Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv`).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to summarize the datasetâ€™s main characteristics and uncover patterns. Key insights include:

- **Age Distribution**: Ages range from 27 to 59, with a median of 42 years.
- **Sleep Duration**: Ranges from 5.8 to 8.5 hours, averaging approximately 7.2 hours.
- **Sleep Quality**: Mean rating of 7.3, with most values between 6 and 9.
- **Physical Activity**: Daily activity spans 30 to 90 minutes, with a mean of 60 minutes.
- **Stress Levels**: Ranges from 3 to 8, averaging 5.4.
- **BMI Categories**: Predominantly "Normal" or "Overweight" categories.
- **Sleep Disorders**: Among recorded cases, "None" is most common, followed by "Insomnia" and "Sleep Apnea."

Visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, correlation matrices) revealed:
- A negative correlation between stress levels and sleep quality, suggesting higher stress may reduce sleep quality.
- Potential relationships between physical activity and sleep duration, warranting further investigation.

This EDA provides a foundation for deeper statistical or predictive analysis.
